UPGRADING

As Above but first deactivate the existing plugin.
This is so when you activate the new plugin it'll run any required upgrades.

If upgrading from a version older than 0.6.1 see the NOTES section.


QUICK SUBDOMAINS HOWTO 

The plugin uses the Category slug, Page slug, or Author name as the subdomain name.

You'll need to configure your webserver for each subdomain you want to use. It uses the same wordpress install as your main blog.
If you run your own server you should know how todo this already (Apache users can just add ServerAlias to their existing vhost)
If you use managed hosting then add a subdomain and set it's document path to that of your main blog.

Be sure to add a DNS entry to point your subdomains to your server.

Note, some hosting services allow a forward all rule that will forward all subdomains to your server.

For each Category you want to convert, edit the category in wordpress admin and enable the "Make Subdomain" option.

For each Page you want to convert, edit the page in wordpress admin and add the custom field "wps_page_subdomain" with value "true"

For Author subdomains just switch enable the "Activate Author Subdomains" setting. You cannot pick and choose which authors are subdomains.
It is either all or none.

PAGE CONFIGURATION

Subdomain Page
To make static pages act like subdomains, create a custom field variable "wps_page_subdomain" and set it to true.

Custom Theme
To set a theme for a page subdomain, create a custom field variable "wps_page_theme" and set it to the theme that 
you want to use. The theme name is the same as you'll find it on the edit categories page. Themes only work for pages 
that are setup as subdomains.

Tie a Page to a Category
To tie a static page to a subdomained category, so that it displays this URL category.yourdomain.com/static-page, 
create a custom field variable "wps_tie_to_category" and set it to the category ID.

Show Page on all Categories
To make a page show on all pages even if a category is set to only show tied pages, create a custom field varaible called 
"wps_showall" and set it to true.


These custom field names can be changed to whatever you want by editing the subdomains.php file.


NOTES

* If using Subdomains you'll probably want your cookie to span the subdomains and not just your own domain.
  In order to achieve this you need to add an option to your wp-config.php:
    define('COOKIE_DOMAIN', '.mydomain.com');
  Where mydomain.com is your domain name. Remember to add the preceeding dot (.) as this is what makes it work.
  
* If you used the original plugin this was based on and require some of it's custom functions they are still available
	In subdomains.php just uncomment the line that reads:
	//require_once ('plugin/deprecated.php');

* In 0.6.1 Subdomain Roots as Indexes became an option where before it was just on by default. If you want your subdomain
  root pages treated like your main blog index then switch this on. The differences you'll see are down to how your theme 
  handles an Index compared with an Archive.
